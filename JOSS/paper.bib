              Motivation 
              The insertion sequence ({IS}) elements are the smallest but most abundant autonomous transposable elements in prokaryotic genomes, which play a key role in prokaryotic genome organization and evolution. With the fast growing genomic data, it is becoming increasingly critical for biology researchers to be able to accurately and automatically annotate {ISs} in prokaryotic genome sequences. The available automatic {IS} annotation systems are either providing only incomplete {IS} annotation or relying on the availability of existing genome annotations. Here, we present a new {IS} elements annotation pipeline to address these issues. 
             
             
              Results 
              {ISEScan} is a highly sensitive software pipeline based on profile hidden Markov models constructed from manually curated {IS} elements. {ISEScan} performs better than existing {IS} annotation systems when tested on prokaryotic genomes with curated annotations of {IS} elements. Applying it to 2784 prokaryotic genomes, we report the global distribution of {IS} families across taxonomic clades in Archaea and Bacteria. 
             
             
              Availability and implementation 
              {ISEScan} is implemented in Python and released as an open source software at https://github.com/xiezhq/{ISEScan}.

            Summary: The multiplex capability and high yield of current day {DNA}-sequencing instruments has made bacterial whole genome sequencing a routine affair. The subsequent de novo assembly of reads into contigs has been well addressed. The final step of annotating all relevant genomic features on those contigs can be achieved slowly using existing web- and email-based systems, but these are not applicable for sensitive data or integrating into computational pipelines. Here we introduce Prokka, a command line software tool to fully annotate a draft bacterial genome in about 10 min on a typical desktop computer. It produces standards-compliant output files for further analysis or viewing in genome browsers.

Interactions take place at different scales—local for gene expression, global for replication—and lead to the differentiation of the chromosome into organizational units such as operons, replichores, or macrodomains. These processes are intermingled in the cell and create complex higher-level organizational features that are adaptive because they favor the interplay between the processes. The surprising result of selection for genome organization is that gene repertoires change much more quickly than chromosomal structure. Comparative genomics and experimental genomic manipulations are untangling the different cellular and evolutionary mechanisms causing such resilience to change. Since organization results from cellular processes, a better understanding of chromosome organization will help unravel the underlying cellular processes and their diversity.},

Yet the way it impacts on the bacterial chromosome was not fully acknowledged until the availability of complete genomes allowed one to look upon genomes as more than bags of genes. Chromosomal replication includes a set of asymmetric mechanisms, among which are a division in a lagging and a leading strand and a gradient between early and late replicating regions. These differences are the causes of many of the organizational features observed in bacterial genomes, in terms of both gene distribution and sequence composition along the chromosome. When asymmetries or gradients increase in some genomes, e.g. due to a different composition of the {DNA} polymerase or to a higher growth rate, so do the corresponding biases. As some of the features of the chromosome structure seem to be under strong selection, understanding such biases is important for the understanding of chromosome organization and adaptation. Inversely, understanding chromosome organization may shed further light on questions relating to replication and cell division.

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT} 
             
              Large-scale rearrangements may be important in evolution because they can alter chromosome organization and gene expression in ways not possible through point mutations. In a long-term evolution experiment, twelve 
              Escherichia coli 
              populations have been propagated in a glucose-limited environment for over 25 years. We used whole-genome mapping (optical mapping) combined with genome sequencing and {PCR} analysis to identify the large-scale chromosomal rearrangements in clones from each population after 40,000 generations. A total of 110 rearrangement events were detected, including 82 deletions, 19 inversions, and 9 duplications, with lineages having between 5 and 20 events. In three populations, successive rearrangements impacted particular regions. In five populations, rearrangements affected over a third of the chromosome. Most rearrangements involved recombination between insertion sequence ({IS}) elements, illustrating their importance in mediating genome plasticity. Two lines of evidence suggest that at least some of these rearrangements conferred higher fitness. First, parallel changes were observed across the independent populations, with {\textasciitilde}65\% of the rearrangements affecting the same loci in at least two populations. For example, the ribose-utilization operon and the 
              {manB} 
              - 
              {cpsG} 
              region were deleted in 12 and 10 populations, respectively, suggesting positive selection, and this inference was previously confirmed for the former case. Second, optical maps from clones sampled over time from one population showed that most rearrangements occurred early in the experiment, when fitness was increasing most rapidly. However, some rearrangements likely occur at high frequency and may have simply hitchhiked to fixation. In any case, large-scale rearrangements clearly influenced genomic evolution in these populations. 
             
             
              {IMPORTANCE} 
              Bacterial chromosomes are dynamic structures shaped by long histories of evolution. Among genomic changes, large-scale {DNA} rearrangements can have important effects on the presence, order, and expression of genes. Whole-genome sequencing that relies on short {DNA} reads cannot identify all large-scale rearrangements. Therefore, deciphering changes in the overall organization of genomes requires alternative methods, such as optical mapping. We analyzed the longest-running microbial evolution experiment (more than 25 years of evolution in the laboratory) by optical mapping, genome sequencing, and {PCR} analyses. We found multiple large genome rearrangements in all 12 independently evolving populations. In most cases, it is unclear whether these changes were beneficial themselves or, alternatively, hitchhiked to fixation with other beneficial mutations. In any case, many genome rearrangements accumulated over decades of evolution, providing these populations with genetic plasticity reminiscent of that observed in some pathogenic bacteria.

            Duplication-containing cells are selected when growth of Salmonella typhimurium is limited by the availability of any one of several carbon and energy sources. Under conditions of extreme starvation, growth occurs almost exclusively in the duplication-containing fraction of the population. Cells with duplications of one large segment of the chromosome are repeatedly selected regardless of which of these carbon sources limits growth. The duplicated chromosomal segment encodes the transport systems for all of these carbon sources. This duplication is not selected during growth on a carbon source for which the permease is not included within the duplication segment. This suggests that the growth advantage conferred by the duplication may be due to increased transport of the limiting carbon source. Inclusion of the permease alone is not sufficient to explain the growth advantage of the duplications, since other common duplications that include the permease are not selected.},

However, given the relatively high error rates of such technologies, efficient and accurate assembly of large repeats and closely related haplotypes remains challenging. We address these issues with Canu, a successor of Celera Assembler that is specifically designed for noisy single-molecule sequences. Canu introduces support for nanopore sequencing, halves depth-of-coverage requirements, and improves assembly continuity while simultaneously reducing runtime by an order of magnitude on large genomes versus Celera Assembler 8.2. These advances result from new overlapping and assembly algorithms, including an adaptive overlapping strategy based on tf-idf weighted {MinHash} and a sparse assembly graph construction that avoids collapsing diverged repeats and haplotypes. We demonstrate that Canu can reliably assemble complete microbial genomes and near-complete eukaryotic chromosomes using either Pacific Biosciences ({PacBio}) or Oxford Nanopore technologies and achieves a contig {NG}50 of {\textgreater}21 Mbp on both human and Drosophila melanogaster {PacBio} data sets. For assembly structures that cannot be linearly represented, Canu provides graph-based assembly outputs in graphical fragment assembly ({GFA}) format for analysis or integration with complementary phasing and scaffolding techniques. The combination of such highly resolved assembly graphs with long-range scaffolding information promises the complete and automated assembly of complex genomes.},

Here, we report our findings on a bacterium that generates a reversible, large-scale inversion of its chromosome (about half of its total genome) at high frequencies of up to once every four generations. This inversion switches on or off bacterial phenotypes, including colony morphology, antibiotic susceptibility, hemolytic activity, and expression of dozens of genes. Quantitative measurements and mathematical analyses indicate that this reversible switching is stochastic but self-organized so as to maintain two forms of stable cell populations (i.e., small colony variant, normal colony variant) as a bet-hedging strategy. Thus, this heritable and reversible genome fluctuation seems to govern the bacterial life cycle; it has a profound impact on the course and outcomes of bacterial infections.

            Author Summary 
             
              The biological and medical implications for the chromosome inversion in Mu50Ω remain to be elucidated. However, our study has revealed that large-scale, reversible chromosome inversion could be one of the ingenious strategies that 
              S. aureus 
              uses to survive in adverse environments. The {SCVs} facilitate escape from immune attacks, whereas the {NCVs} are resistant to antibiotic treatment during infection. 
             
             
              Transcriptional profiling revealed that the expression of dozens of genes involved in energy metabolism is down-regulated in Mu50Ω1, or {SCV}, compared with Mu50Ω2, or {NCV}. This may be associated with the {SCV} phenotype, but the reason why genome inversion could lead to such a change in the transcriptional profile remains unknown. The chromosome recombination sites involved in the inversion were identified to be the two mutually homologous loci present in the left and right chromosome replichores, the two segments of the bacteria’s genome that are oppositely replicated during cell division ( 
               
                Fig. P1 
                B 
               
              ). Homologous recompilation mediated by the {DNA}-repair enzyme {RecA} is considered to be involved in the inversion and asymmetry inversion rates between {SCV} and {NCV}. 
             
            It remained unclear, however, how {SCV} was able to persist in the culture despite its low growth rate relative to {NCV}. To answer this question, we developed a mathematical model based on the standard Lotka–Volterra equation for the competitive growth of two cell subpopulations, with some modifications made by incorporating the flip-flop chromosome inversion mechanism and bacterial degradation effects. To reproduce the experimental growth curve data, a difference in the rates of chromosome inversion in {SCV} and {NCV} will be necessary, with a rate ∼12.5-fold greater in {SCV} cells compared with {NCV} cells. When this condition is satisfied, cultures of either {SCV} or {NCV} could constantly maintain the two subpopulations. 
             
              To understand the mechanism of phenotypic switching, we picked one colony from each subpopulation to establish the Mu50Ω1 ({SCV}) and Mu50Ω2 ({NCV}) strains ( 
               
                Fig. P1 
                A 
               
              ) and conducted comparative phenotypic and genetic studies, including whole-genome sequence comparison. The phenotype of a mixed colony persisted because of the two-way transition between {NCV} and {SCV} during the growing process. The {SCV} colonies were distinguishable by various characteristics. In addition to smaller colony size, {SCV} exhibited less colony pigmentation, impaired hemolytic activity on blood agar, and susceptibility to certain types of antibiotics. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that Mu50Ω2 has a circular chromosome, almost half of which inverts in orientation relative to that of the alternative Mu50Ω1 genome ( 
               
                Fig. P1 
                B 
               
              ). This inversion was reversible, which results in the phenotypic switching of the two bacterial subpopulations. 
             
             
              The strain Mu50Ω was isolated from a patient with a relapsed surgical site infection. When streaked onto agar plates, this strain consistently formed colonies of two distinct sizes, despite repeated colony purification ( 
               
                Fig. P1 
                A 
               
              ). One of the subpopulations had a slow-growing phenotype, and was therefore designated as the small colony variant ({SCV}). Such a phenotype of 
              S. aureus 
              has been previously associated with infection persistence and relapse ( 
              3 
              ). The other subpopulation retained normal growth capability, therefore forming colonies of normal size. This subpopulation was therefore designated as the normal colony variant ({NCV}) in this study. We further found that these two distinct cell subpopulations could repeatedly transition from one to the other. Additional investigation revealed that colonies of both types were persistently observed in the descendants of both types of originating cell populations, although the ratios of {NCV} to {SCV} varied. The prevalence of {NCV} in the {SCV}-descendant cell populations was ∼0.1–0.3\%, compared with 90–99\% in the {NCV}-descendant cell populations. 
             
             
              The genome inversion, a reversal of a large segment of a chromosome, is thought to play an important role in maintaining cell subpopulations, contributing various biological features in bacteria, and permitting adaptation to changes in the physical environment. Although the evidence for recurrent genome inversion is widely observed in nature when the genomes of closely related species are compared ( 
              1 
              , 
              2 
              ), little is known about the mechanism of occurrence and the physiological effect of recurrent genome inversion. In this study, we clarified that the 
              Staphylococcus aureus 
              clinical strain Mu50Ω undergoes frequent, large-scale genome reversible inversion during in vitro cultivation.},

            The stability of the structure of bacterial genomes is challenged by recombination events. Since major rearrangements (i.e., inversions) are thought to frequently operate by homologous recombination between inverted repeats, we analyzed the presence and distribution of such repeats in bacterial genomes and their relation to the conservation of chromosomal structure. First, we show that there is a strong underrepresentation of inverted repeats, relative to direct repeats, in most chromosomes, especially among the ones regarded as most stable. Second, we show that the avoidance of repeats is frequently associated with the stability of the genomes. Closely related genomes reported to differ in terms of stability are also found to differ in the number of inverted repeats. Third, when using replication strand bias as a proxy for genome stability, we find a significant negative correlation between this strand bias and the abundance of inverted repeats. Fourth, when measuring the recombining potential of inverted repeats and their eventual impact on different features of the chromosomal structure, we observe a tendency of repeats to be located in the chromosome in such a way that rearrangements produce a smaller strand switch and smaller asymmetries than expected by chance. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our analysis and the influence of factors such as the nature of repeats, e.g., transposases, or the differences in the recombination machinery among bacteria. These results shed light on the challenges imposed on the genome structure by the presence of inverted repeats.},

              Summary 
              Third-generation genome sequencing technologies have led to a sharp increase in the number of high-quality genome assemblies. This allows the comparison of multiple assembled genomes of individual species and demands new tools for visualizing their structural properties. Here, we present plotsr, an efficient tool to visualize structural similarities and rearrangements between genomes. It can be used to compare genomes on chromosome level or to zoom in on any selected region. In addition, plotsr can augment the visualization with regional identifiers (e.g. genes or genomic markers) or histogram tracks for continuous features (e.g. {GC} content or polymorphism density). 
             
             
              Availability and implementation 
              plotsr is implemented as a python package and uses the standard matplotlib library for plotting. It is freely available under the {MIT} license at {GitHub} (https://github.com/schneebergerlab/plotsr) and bioconda (https://anaconda.org/bioconda/plotsr).
